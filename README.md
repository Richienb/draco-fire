### Draco Fire

This game is about different types of dragons in a war, and it is going to be called Draco fire (my favourite word is Draco for some odd reason.). This is a very complex game and I need experienced drawers to make this game work. If you know how to code in Python, please feel free to help. We have to get this done next year but we are lacking the ability to sode, I am new to coding and my friend is a good coder but can not draw very well. I only have one person drawing and he cannot code because he is too busy, so I need a few people to help draw the pics. I deleted my old account, lunala1, and I replaced it with my new account. which is...ShinyArceus1
