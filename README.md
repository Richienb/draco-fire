## Draco Fire

This game is about different types of dragons in a war, and it is going to be called Draco fire (my favourite word is Draco for some odd reason.). This is a very complex game and I need experienced drawers to make this game work. This is a game that is not finished yet. If you know how to code in Python, please feel free to help.
